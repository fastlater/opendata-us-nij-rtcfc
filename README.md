This repository provides access to an **open data** packaged version of the calls-for-service (CFS) datasets published by the Portland Police Bureau (PPB) for the [National Institute of Justice Real-Time Crime Forecasting Challenge](http://nij.gov/funding/Pages/fy16-crime-forecasting-challenge.aspx). The Challenge, offering up to $1.2 million dollars in price, seeks to harness the advances in â€‹data science to address the challenges of crime and justice. It is open to  open to individuals and businesses and runs from Septenber 2016 to February 2017.

Our company, [Metadata Technology North America](http://wwwm.mtna.us), provides products, services, expertise, and cloud infrastructure aiming at imrproving access and usefulness of data by leveraging modern technologies and metadata. We believe that better data can create a better world. By repackaging the NIJ Challenge data into open formats, we hope to support the initiative by making the datasets easier to access, use, and analysis.

## What's made available here?
The following components are available:

* A cumulative version of the **calls-for-service (CFS) data** is available in **comma separated (CSV)** and **fixed ASCII** and fixed text tormats in the ```/data``` directory. This has been extracted from the dBase files and combines the yearly data files publsihed by NIJ into a single dataset.
* **Programs** to read the text data in [**SAS**](http://www.sas.com), [**SPSS**](http://www.spss.com), [**Stata**](http://www.stata.com), [**R**](http://www.r-project.com) are in the [```/syntax```](syntax) directory. These include when relevant syntax for value labels.
* **SQL scripts** to create and load the data in [**MS-SQL**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/sql-server), [**MySql**](http://www.mysql.com), [**MonetDB**](http://www.monetdb.org), [**Oracle**](http://www.oracle.com), [**Vertica**](www.vertica.com) databases are in the ```/sql``` directory. This includes code to generate the database schema. These scripts rely on the SQL friendly version of the data (.sql.csv files).
* **Metadata** in [**DDI**](http://www.ddialliance.org) and [**Triple-S**](http://www.triple-s.org) are available in the [```/metadata```](metadata) directory . **Descriptive statistics** (summary and frequencies) are also available in CSV files.

This project will be updated as new data is made available by NIJ. See expected publication schedule on the Challenge web site.
